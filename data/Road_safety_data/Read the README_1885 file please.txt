Create two folders one called 'code' to contain codes only and move all scripts into this folder. 

The other folder named 'data' and move all excel files into it.

This will allow the project to be reproduced


# ==================================================================
# Data Creation for Project  
# ==================================================================

# Read multiple files from source folder

# Data Download links: Please download data from the following links (Copy the links below into any browser)
    
#  Vehicles Data: https://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/dft-road-casualty-statistics-vehicle-1979-latest-published-year.csv
#  Collisions Data: https://data.dft.gov.uk/road-accidents-safety-data/dft-road-casualty-statistics-collision-1979-latest-published-year.csv

# Save downloaded data in this folder: \data\Road_safety_data

# The main folder should have two folders 'code' folder for codes only and 'data' folder for data only

# There are three codes and should be run in that order to reproduce the results. 

However, feel free to code 3 named: SCV_Forecasting_Code_Wales_Final v1  to get the results
